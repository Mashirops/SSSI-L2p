# SSSI-L2p

This is the source file for 'SSSI-L2p: An EEG Extended Source Imaging Algorithm Based on the Structured Sparse Regularization with $L_2p$-Norm'.

We provide the main code of the proposed method SSSI-L2p in 'SSSI_L2p_ADMM.m' and the corresponding simulating protocal in 'SSSI_Simulation.m'.

Run 'SSSI_Simulation.m' with only a slight configuration of Brainstorm.
